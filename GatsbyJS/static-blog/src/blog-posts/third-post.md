## Using an iPhone made me realize why I love Android

iPhones are often lauded for their simplicity and their uniformity, and to be honest, it’s an interesting prospect. The world of Android can be murky and confusing, with hundreds of options if you really want to do your research on choosing the device that suits you. For most people, an iPhone probably does the job, but is it really the best option? I’d argue that it isn’t, especially when there are hundreds of Android devices all with different priorities for a different type of user.

### Android offers versatility that I can’t find anywhere else

The iPhone is certainly a fantastic phone that can suit basically anyone that wants a phone that does it all, but there’s no versatility in what it can do. iPhones don’t have the best cameras and camera setups (with the caveat that their video capabilities are exceptional), iPhones don’t have the best displays, and they don’t have the best design… though that last part is largely subjective. I will concede that iPhones have the most consistent cameras, insofar as I know that every photo I take on any lens will have a minimum quality expectation that I can realistically hope to achieve.

To be fair to iPhones, they do have fantastic chipsets — but that doesn’t really matter when compared to what an iPhone can actually do. It doesn’t matter how powerful a chipset is if you can’t really do anything with that aside from performing in benchmarks and having good performance in games. Not only that, their software can have a lot of problems, and I’ve had some quite buggy experiences on iOS 15. There are so many things that I found myself wondering why it didn’t just work, despite believing that Apple’s mantra was more or less “it just works”. A prime example of this is why doesn’t holding down the power button surface a power menu? Why does it have to be a chore to restart my phone?
